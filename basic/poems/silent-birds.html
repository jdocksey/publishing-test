    <h1 class="poem-title">Silent Birds</h1>

    <pre class="poem-content">
I still gaze
    into the emerging stars
    at dusk.

I used to wait
    (do I still wish?)
    for your womanly voice
    as I began my walks home.

I no longer laugh among our friends,
    but with my hands clasped,
    just wait for our joke to end.

And the sight of silent birds
    with wide black wings
    is no longer unwelcome,
    nor a surprise.

My skies are filled,
    while my cupboards
    remain bare.
