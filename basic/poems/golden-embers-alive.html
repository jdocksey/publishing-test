    <h1 class="poem-title">Golden Embers Alive</h1>

    <pre class="poem-content">
We rise like ashes of bonfire
    on summer's trailing edge,
    (we are golden embers alive)
into the towering depths
    of liquid heaven above
    we sink;
we are poured out
    over aching woods and crumbling leaves,
    over jagged shores and fierce deserts:

We are homebound,
    finally resting ourselves in dusty origin,
    now with eternal flame
    immanent in our blood.
