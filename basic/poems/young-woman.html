    <pre class="poem-content">
Young woman,
        with whom I will
        gladly share my name:
    I am a faulty wire
        hot with current,
        yearning for release.

For my dreams have been pent up for ages,
        and my hands I have just untied.
    I imagine you a safeguard
        for my heart's hopes,
        and a mighty sail
        for its desires untried.
