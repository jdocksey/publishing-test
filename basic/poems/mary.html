[verse]
Seeking hard-earned consolations
    in light of heavy resignation,
Days of nervous tribulation
    tending to junk heart termination.

[alternate verse 1]
Seeking hard-earned consolation;
    in place, lead weight: resignation.
Scarred, burning days of tribulation;
    junk heart - termination.

[chorus]
If I drown -
    Will you give me rise from under?
When the moon falls -
    Will you lead me back to beauty?

[verse]
Broken hopes, bitter anticipation;
    last chance, missed dance; twitching hesitation.
Steel eyes, self-centered determination;
    hard-morning examination.

[chorus]
Can I pull through
    dark hours of heavy thunder?
Only when lightning strikes
    do I know my heart.

[chorus]
Blest are you -
    and I wish I could be gentle;
Pray for me -
    at the hour of separation:

    Take me through your heart
        to the one you love.
