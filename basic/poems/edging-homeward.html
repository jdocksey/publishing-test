    <pre class="poem-content">
I am edging homeward by grace;
                I am slipping with raucous pleasure to Hell;
I am shyly accepting Hope;
                I am gleefully slitting Hope's throat with habit.

I am polishing
    quiet, dusty dreams;
                I am grinding diamonds
                    against death.



                I give myself in
                    to myself and what I suffer;
                    I fold, collapse,
                        and I am waste.

I give myself up
    to this othersome joy
    I know only by fearful awe;
    I am filled, centered,
        and held.



    From here I depart,
                always to the same;
            
            To here I return,
        always more,
            always changed.
