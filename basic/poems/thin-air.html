    <h1 class="poem-title">Thin Air</h1>

    <pre class="poem-content">
Thin is our air,
    and pale the sky.

I stand on front stoop,
    tongue cleaved to flesh,
    and shiver softly
        with hollow head.

Dear friend,
    If the sun returns hot
        to crash in dry tempest,
        know that I have left early,
            with only dust behind.

    For though I am alien
        to these streets,
        all is familiar:

    I know the blessed scent
        of dark soil turned rich,
    and the decay of man
        steeped in wealth;

    I have heard the screaming void
        of raped autumn nights,
    and the quiet hope
        of gentle open evenings;

    I have felt the heat
        of crackling wreckage,
    and the soft bed of prairie
        wet with evening dew;
    
    I know the ends of our idols
        and the joy of their burial.
    
    So if wind quits
        and earth turns bare and burned,
        you can walk by my door
            without a knock
        and traverse the hard trail
            from cement to stone and dirt.
    
    Later, if by ditch
        you find me,
        rouse me without restraint;
            my dreams I have woken into,
                and I know our justice is late.
        
    Our future? It is beyond my sight;
        but I sense it hangs,
            slack in suspension,
        waiting above our blue shadows
            between sun-baked steeples.
