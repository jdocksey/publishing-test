    <h1 class="poem-title">Tips of Flesh</h1>

    <pre class="poem-content">
Tips of flesh,
fresh with wind-nipped
burn, coil around
coal-dark heat
in cup, while
naked sun sinks
over blue crystal
streets, sides piled
rough with slush
of travel-beaten
Heaven's dust.

Our blood and joy
mix as voices
mingle, and our
spirits rise
like steam as stars
make sharp against
glossy lavender sky,
slit by spires
and blazened by bells.
