    <h1 class="poem-title">Owl And Moon</h1>

    <pre class="poem-content">
Familiar sun glances
    across deep summer sky,
    and rests gently
    on our golden home.
Soon we will be bathed,
    all faces bright,
    in bonfire's amber glow.

As we soak
    in the nectar of night
    and embers dance
    before our eyes -

Dad,
    will you share
    the telling with me,
    again?
How the owls and the moon
    bear witness to
    and rejoice in
    another full day lived?

Will you recall for me
    our holidays
    traveling over gravel
    and through sunsets
    to Mama's parent's farm?
I was small,
    and I remember
    pulling in near midnight,
    and being greeted
    with coffee and cards.

I remember mornings
    as promises fulfilled:
    Christmas day, thickly white,
    we were gathered
    sharing, holding, giving gifts,
    living
    side-by-side.

Oh, now older,
    with aching in my bones,
I desire
    to know
    at depths too great
    to forget,
if these memories
    of good nights and homes
    will blend edges together,
    becoming dappled panoramas,
    living,
    and solid as stone.

For I have decided:
    I do not wish to disappear.
    I want to stay, mixed,
    living in our hot laughter,
    quiet joy
    and somber tears.

I want to be fixed,
    and have my place be permanent
    at home:
to remain attached
    to the branch above,
    and swing freely
    in golden, gentle,
    setting sun.
