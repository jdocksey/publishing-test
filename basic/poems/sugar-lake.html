I do not remember the mornings,
but I can go back to the nights;
I was in bed,
ready for sleep,
    and young;
    a boy.



I opened my eyes, and saw my father.
I think he was quiet,
    perhaps asleep.

I laid still, and my blood was warm,
and it moved through my heart.
Its founts were joys,
each amplified by promises
    of cousins,
    of grandparents,
    of my father's siblings;
        all livened by my father's presence and word.



I was a child then,
and I am learning
    to be young
    again.

There was warmth in my blood,

Its founts were joys of the day,
amplified by promises

    of my father's siblings;
        and strengthened by my father's words.
