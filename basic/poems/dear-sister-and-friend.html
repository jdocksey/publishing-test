    <pre class="poem-content">
Dear Sister, Friend,

    Today I thought of you.

I gaze over the fertile field
    beyond my yard's edge,
and stretching back over the grass,
    recall your scent.

Before me is a flowering tree,
    pure in its blossoming,
and beyond my vision your face rises;
    your name follows.

As you stand - gracious -
    in my imagination,
the hearty soil grows richer underneath
    and the colorful birdsongs multiply.

Behind, in the house, the wide boards of soft wood floors
    bend gently below your feet;
but it is my chest
    that aches and creaks.

Have you heard my home shift
    from brick house to my heart?
And there is room,
    new,
        for another.

So tomorrow I shall present open palms,
    and ask for you
in entirety.

For as the robin bares its breast to ascend
    and bluejay shocks earthly neighbor with heavenly hue,
so I hear from my bones drumming
    for self-sacrifice that fills the womb,
        and transforms full woman
            into mother.
