    <h1 class="poem-title">Rise (I Hope We Dance)</h1>

    <pre class="poem-content">
We stepped from hope
    into dance
    when we wed.
I remember how
    brush and glance
    turned
    to taste and touch,
how our great oak floors
    turned
    warm under the quiet morning sun;
and how we learned
    to dance together,
the flesh of our feet
    wearing the wood,
    my hands guiding your curves;

We
    turned
    about the spirit
    keeping us
    and
    kept between us.

All our steps were new
    and grounded,
    planted in trust
    and surrender.
We grew
    together.

Until you
    turned

    inward
    and
    away.

Now,
    the clocks tick
    without mercy.

Now, the spirit moans,
    and my hands are torn open;
Now my feet are flayed,
    numb on oak floor rotten;
Now I taste
    and caress
    naught.

    ...

To sweep the desert
    bare with holy wind
    until it be free of sand,
to wander outside your cold house
    until you walk out again,
to dance with you on repeat
    on fields of deep cool grass;

I have fought,
I have endured,
and I hope,
    yet -

Even if your freedom
    were again uncovered,
even if you breathed
    open warm air again,
even if you heard your heart
    beat in time with nature's song

- I wonder if you
    would rise,
    release yourself,
and step from stillborn rooms
    into hot windy light,
and again
    join
    our dance.
