    <pre class="poem-content">
The water is draining from the lake.
The wind-waves and sun-lines look unchanged,
    but of them
    there are less.

At the certain end,
    (with wind and sun forever strong)
    I wonder if there will be
    a single comprehending crest and dazzling glisten,
    if the whole lake,
        now so small,
    will let itself be changed
    and become
        entirely and purely
    motion and glow.
