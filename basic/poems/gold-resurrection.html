    <h1 class="poem-title">Gold Resurrection</h1>

    <pre class="poem-content">
Will you unearth it with me,
    what I've come to find -
what has been buried
    through apathy, regrets; in short, wasted time?
And no matter how coal-black
    that dead weight may appear,
I know we can bring it back to gold
    with shared blood and hot tears;

for a dream across generations,
    neglected, forgotten, unsung,
may become tarnished, rusted, and withered, but not yet undone;
    for the threads of redemption
    have never left our hands!

And so, as son, father, let us finally join hands
    to free, what we've been made to give and to share,
from our selfish appetites and proclivity of despair,
    and raise it on the wondrous mysterious frightening heights
        of sacrificial love;
    and watch, and ride together,
        a new tidal wave of rising sun.
