    <h1 class="poem-title">Great Dove</h1>

    <pre class="poem-content">
I remember Saturdays
    before you,
    good and filled,
        but not fecund like this.

This evening glows with life,
    and your deep rose-heart blossoms
    under the falling sun.

Our chests are crossed with charcoal,
        remnants from last night's fire,
    and memories of taste and sweat
    stay with and guide me.

I suffer you slowly, joyfully,
    dancing with your heart (I'm barely tethered);
        we will, soon enough,
        rest, one and content.

I watch as you lay,
        back to ground,
        with heart clamoring for home,
    and I catch echoes of ancestors
    through my quivering bones;
from the rumble of soil -
    Nature's dream, growling from Earth
- to the surface of our skin,
the Great Dove's grace impels us to newness,
    and He warmly thrusts His way
    into our small home.
